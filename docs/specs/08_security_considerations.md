# Security Considerations: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

Security is paramount in an automated trading system. The project implements several layers of protection.

### 1. API Key Management
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate API Keys for Real and Testnet environments stored in a unified configuration.
- **Local Persistence**: Keys are stored encrypted within Hive boxes or provided via environment variables (`.env`).
- **Permission Scoping**: Recommendations for users to restrict API keys to trade-only permissions (disable withdrawals).

### 2. Environment Segregation
- **Prefix Isolation**: As detailed in [Database Schema](../specs/06_database_schema.md), data is strictly segregated via key prefixes.
- **Logical Validation**: The backend validates every trading request against the current active mode to prevent cross-enviroment execution.

### 3. Network Security
- **gRPC with TLS**: Support for encrypted communication between Frontend and Backend.
- **Insecure Mode Toggle**: Optional `ALLOW_INSECURE_GRPC` for development, strictly warned against for production.

### 4. Risk Controls
- **Circuit Breakers**: Distributed across `BinanceOrders`, `BinanceInfo`, and `BinanceAccount` to prevent cascade failures during API instability.
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent weights management to respect Binance's REST and WebSocket limits.
