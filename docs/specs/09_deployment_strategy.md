# Deployment Strategy: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

The system is designed for containerized deployment, ensuring a consistent environment across development, staging (Testnet), and production (Real).

### 1. Primary Components
- **Backend Container**: Uses `dart:stable` as the base image. Compiles the Dart code to a native executable for optimized performance and stability on VPS environments.
- **Envoy Proxy**: Acts as the gRPC-Web bridge, allowing the Flutter Web frontend to communicate with the gRPC backend.
- **Frontend**: Served as a set of static files (HTML/JS/WASM) from an Nginx container or specialized web hosting.

### 2. Orchestration
The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` for simplified multi-container management.
- **Network Mode**: Uses `host` networking for lower latency and simplified configuration.
- **Persistence**: Volume mounts for `hive_data` (database) and `logs`.
- **Certificates**: Mounted volumes for TLS certificates to secure gRPC traffic.

### 3. Monitoring & Health
- **Container Healthchecks**: Uses `pgrep` and `curl` to monitor the backend process and network responsiveness.
- **Restart Policies**: Configured to `always` or `on-failure` with delay to ensure maximum uptime.
