# API Design: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

The system utilizes **gRPC** for efficient, type-safe communication between the backend and frontend.

### Service: `TradingService`
The core service defined in `trading_service.proto` manages all bot operations.

#### Core Methods (Unary)
- `GetSettings` / `UpdateSettings`: Manage bot configuration, including the critical `isTestMode` toggle.
- `StartStrategy` / `StopStrategy`: Control the lifecycle of trading loops for specific symbols.
- `GetStrategyState`: Retrieve the current status, open trades, and performance metrics for a symbol.
- `GetAccountInfo`: Fetch balances across all assets with estimated USDC value.

#### Real-Time Streaming (Server Streaming)
- `SubscribeStrategyState`: Continuous updates on strategy progress and events.
- `SubscribeAccountInfo`: Live balance updates as trades occur.
- `StreamCurrentPrice`: Low-latency price feeds from Binance.
- `SubscribeSystemLogs`: Real-time log stream for diagnostics.

### Data Format
- **Protobuf**: Optimized binary format for high performance.
- **Precision Handling**: Fields include both `double` (legacy) and `string` (precision) representations to avoid floating-point errors in financial calculations.
