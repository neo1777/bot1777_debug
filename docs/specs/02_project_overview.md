# Project Overview: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

NeoTradingBot1777 is a sophisticated automated trading system designed to interface directly with Binance. The project is structured as a mono-repo containing two primary components: a high-performance backend and a rich web-based frontend.

### Component Structure
- **Backend (`neotradingbotback1777`)**: A Dart 3 CLI application serving as the core engine. It manages strategy execution, Binance API communication, and local persistence.
- **Frontend (`neotradingbotfront1777`)**: A Flutter Web application providing a real-time dashboard for monitoring and control.
- **Protocol Definitions (`/proto/`)**: Centralized Protobuf definitions ensuring a single source of truth for communication.

### Core Objectives
1.  **Environment Isolation**: Perfect separation between Testnet and Real trading environments.
2.  **Data Integrity**: Reliable persistence using Hive with zero risk of cross-contamination.
3.  **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Ultra-low latency updates using gRPC streams and WebSocket integrations.
