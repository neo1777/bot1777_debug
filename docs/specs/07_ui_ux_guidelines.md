# UI/UX Guidelines: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

The frontend is designed as a professional-grade trading terminal, prioritizing readability, real-time feedback, and clear environment awareness.

### Design Principles
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Dark mode by default with high-contrast accent colors for trade signals.
- **Immediate Awareness**: Persistent "Mode Indicator" (REAL vs TESTNET) with distinct color schemes to prevent accidental live trades.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle transparency effects in cards to give a modern, layered feel.

### Core Views
1.  **Dashboard**:
    - Real-time Price Widget with 24h change.
    - Active Strategy cards showing status, open trades, and current round profit.
    - Global Account balance chart.
2.  **Strategy Controls**:
    - Quick Start/Stop/Pause buttons.
    - Status indicators (Idle, Running, Paused, Error).
3.  **Trade History**:
    - Sortable table of all executed trades.
    - Detailed trade view including fees and localized profit calculation.
4.  **Settings**:
    - Tabbed configuration for Risk, API Keys, and UI preferences.

### Interaction Patterns
- **Real-Time Updates**: UI components utilize BLoC to react instantly to gRPC stream events.
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback on action triggers while waiting for server confirmation.
