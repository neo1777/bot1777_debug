# Performance Optimization: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

The system is optimized for low-latency trading and stability under load.

### 1. Concurrency Model
- **Dart Isolates**: Each trading symbol runs in its own dedicated isolate. This ensures that a heavy strategy calculation on one symbol does not block others or the main gRPC server.
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking I/O for all network requests.

### 2. Networking Optimizations
- **gRPC Bi-directional Streams**: Reduces overhead compared to polling. Enables real-time price and state synchronization with minimal latency.
- **WebSocket Recovery**: Custom manager with exponential backoff to handle connection drops without service interruption.

### 3. Resilience and Stability
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevents overwhelming Binance APIs during outages. Three levels of strictly configured breakers (`Orders`, `Info`, `Account`).
- **Memory Management**: Hive and streaming controllers are properly disposed of to prevent leaks in long-running processes.

### 4. Precision Control
- **Fixed-Decimal Rendering**: Use of string-based decimal representation for critical financial values to eliminate floating-point precision issues.
