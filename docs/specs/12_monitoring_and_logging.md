# Monitoring & Logging: NeoTradingBot1777

## Status: PROPOSED

Complete visibility into system operations is provided through structured logging and real-time monitoring.

### 1. Unified Logging
- **Log Manager**: A centralized utility built on the `logger` package.
- **Levels**: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL.
- **Multiple Sinks**: Logs are simultaneously written to the console, local rolling files, and the gRPC log stream.

### 2. Real-Time UI Monitoring
- **System Logs Stream**: The frontend receives a real-time stream of backend logs for immediate diagnostics.
- **WebSocket Stats**: A specialized RPC endpoint `GetWebSocketStats` provides metrics on connection health, message counts, and recovery events.

### 3. Business Metrics
- **Performance Tracking**: Time taken for critical operations (e.g., `createOrder`, `getAccountInfo`) is recorded.
- **Strategy Performance**: Cumulative profit, successful/failed rounds, and open trades are exposed via the `StrategyState` stream.
